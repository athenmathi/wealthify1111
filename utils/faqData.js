    question: "1.What is Diabetes Mellitus?",
    answer:
      "Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases in which the person has high blood glucose (blood sugar) level either due to inadequate insulin production or because the bodys cell does not respond properly to insulin or both. It describes a metabolic disorder of multiple etiology characterized by chronic hyperglycemia with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat (dyslipidemia) and protein metabolism resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Your pancreas- an organ, located between your stomach & spine, that helps with digestion-releases a hormone it makes, called insulin, into your blood. Insulin helps your blood carry glucose to all your body cells. Sometimes your body doesnt make enough insulin or the insulin doesnt work the way it should.Glucose then stays in your blood & doesnt reach your cells. Your blood glucose levels get too high & can cause diabetes or pre-diabetes. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause health problem.",
